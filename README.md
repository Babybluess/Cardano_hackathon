### Name project: AuNFTss

### Problem 
Current auction platforms have many limitations such as lack of transparency, easy manipulation, dependence on intermediaries and slow payment processes. Blockchain applications help overcome this by recording transactions publicly, immutably and automating the process through smart contracts. As a result, auctions become transparent, safe, cost-effective and allow users to participate globally while still maintaining control of their assets. At the same time, taking advantage of digital assets such as NFTs to create liquidity in the digital market, making digital assets accessible to more people.

### Solution
Create a dApp that allows the digitization of real world assets (RWA) on the Cardano blockchain, ensuring transparency in transactions, reducing transaction times when working with documents in traditional auctions. Create liquidity for digitized assets, create positions for LPs in providing liquidity for loans collateralized by digital assets.

### Feature

- RWA in auction: Auction real assets on the cardano blockchain network, with many types of auctions such as 1-round auction, multi-part auction, multi-round auction. Each type of auction will be associated with a different type of NFT to ensure the auction type's features are transparent and the appropriate processing is performed on Cardano.

- Lending NFT: Borrowing cryptocurrencies by collateralizing digital assets stores the value of real-life assets such as NFTs, you can collateralize digital assets to borrow cryptocurrencies and can get the assets back when you repay the loan and accompanying commissions.

- LP: It also has a liquidity provision feature for LPs when they want to earn commissions from providing liquidity to pools that support collateralized loans.
